# AniLib

AniLib is an open source anime library and tracker with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
AniLib uses [Jikan.NET](https://github.com/Ervie/jikan.net) to fetch and retrieve data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
The UI is built using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), a cross platform UI framework (because all the other ones suck :P).
